		<h2>open source and linux</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">
		Everyone should use open source software and Linux because it gives you better controll over your computer and
		it is a good option if you want to separate yourself from all the big tech companies that steal your data.
		However most poeple just want to get work done without worring about setting up their computer and they think
		configuring linux is just a waste of time. But the time you put into it all becomes worth it for the
		extensibility and privacy that linux provides. Windows also comes with much more stuff preinstalled which makes it
		recource intensive while linux is light and super fast. The biggest advantage to using linux in my oppinion
		is that it forces you to learn new things about your computer and make you an overall smarter more valuable
		developer.</p>
